# SportSee - sport analytics dashboard

SportSee is an application that provides users with a personalized dashboard displaying analytics of their sports activities. It tracks sport sessions, daily weight, calories burned, and offers a score reflecting progress toward fitness goals â€” helping users stay motivated on their health journey.

This app was developed as part of the [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/) curriculum.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View personalized graphics and scores
- Interact with graphics to display tooltips

### Links

- Live Site URL: [See the live page here](https://sport-see-tawny.vercel.app/user/18)
- Backend Repository: [Forked backend used in this project](https://github.com/Kasia307584/sport_see-analytics-dashboard--backend)

## My process

### Built with

- **React.js** for building the user interface
- **React Router** for setting up dynamic routing based on user ID
- **Recharts** library for data visualization
- **API REST** for fetching server data
- **CSS3** and **BEM methodology** for styling and maintainable code structure
- **Vercel** for seamless deployment and hosting

### What I learned

- Using the Recharts library to create advanced charts for data visualizations.
- Working with an API web service to fetch data through endpoints.
- Developing a dedicated API call service to ensure data quality by fetching and formatting data for use within the application.
- Implementing a toggle mechanism to switch between mocked and fetched data, allowing for testing of data handling by the API call service.
- Using the `useEffect` React hook to perform side effects, such as data fetching.
- Using `Outlet` build-in React Router component to handle nested routes.
- Following React best practices by appliyng the principle of passing props from the parent component rather than adding conditional logic in child components.
- Gaining a better understanding of the React component lifecycle, specifically the asynchronous nature of data fetching, which results in a component rendering twice. Ensured safe access to data by checking for `undefined` values before use:

```javascript
function Dashboard() {
  const [userData, setData] = useState();

  useEffect(() => {
    // fetch formatted data asynchronously when the component mounts or userId changes
    getFormattedData(Number.parseInt(userId, 10)).then((data) => {
      setData(data);
    });
  }, [userId]);
  // userData is initially undefined after the first render due to asynchronous data fetching

  return (
    // check for undefined before use to prevent errors
    <>
      <UserGreeting userName={userData?.firstName} />
      <ActivityChart sessions={userData?.sessions} />
      <ScoreChart todayScore={userData?.todayScore} />
    </>
  );
}
```

- Running a provided backend locally.
- Using `CSS Modules` for component-scoped styling, allowing one CSS file per component.
- Building a well-structured project, including components, pages, router, services, styles and images.

### Continued development

- add utils to the project tree structure (`constants.js` containing mocked data, backend routes, etc.)
- remove hardcoded and repeated data in services to follow the DRY principle: first, set up routes in a separate file (`constants.js`), then simplify the code in `getData.js` by creating a single funciton with two parameters: `userId` and the ending part of the URL
- replace the function that formats data by a modeling class (OOP)
- move all inline styles from Rechart components into dedicated CSS files
